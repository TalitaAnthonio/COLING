      "Being resourceful is an excelent skill especially when the presures on. Being creative and assesing whats around you will be your best skills. Also logging/classifying things in your brain will be rather helpful. Don't be affraid of trying. Trial and Error are one of the best ways of being resoursful as attempts will build of eachother and although your first idea mightve been foolish the creativity that might come from it will probally give you the answer. So the Key to being resoursful is just instead of saying something can't be done get the brain working youd be amazed how much power it has\n",

No guide can address every possible situation that might arise, but here are a few general guidelines.\n",

      "49 ## Steps\n",
      "51 1. Be prepared. You can't anticipate everything, but you can anticipate many things, and the more you can prepare for, the more resources you'll have to draw upon when faced with a problem.\n",
      "52 * Build a tool kit and learn to use it. The more tools you have to draw on when met with a challenge, the more resourceful you can be. This could be a true tool kit, or it could be a <a href=\"Pick%20Items%20to%20Put%20Inside%20a%20Purse\">purse</a>, a <a href=\"Change%20a%20Diaper\">diaper bag</a>, a <a href=\"Be%20Prepared%20for%20Natural%20Disasters\">survival kit</a>, a <a href=\"Buy%20Power%20Tools\">workshop</a>, a <a href=\"Organize%20a%20Kitchen\">kitchen</a>, an <a href=\"Secure%20Items%20in%20the%20Back%20of%20Your%20Truck\">equipment truck</a>, or even your selection of <a href=\"Make%20a%20List%20for%20Gear%20to%20Take%20Camping\">camping gear</a>. Learn to use your tools. Then, make sure you have it with you when you need it.\n",
      "53 * Practice at home. If you don't know how to <a href=\"Change%20a%20Tire\">change a tire</a>, try it in your driveway before you get a flat miles away from home, in the dark, in the rain. Learn to <a href=\"Pitch%20a%20Pop%20up%20Tent\">pitch your tent</a> in the back yard, or take a short day hike to get used to your backpacking gear. Refine both your tool kit and your skills before you must put them to the test.\n",
      "54 * Anticipate likely problems and deal with them <a href=\"Be%20Proactive\">before they become problems</a>. If you worry that you might forget your keys and <a href=\"Pick%20a%20Lock\">lock yourself out</a>, hide a spare key in the back yard. Attach your keys to something large and visible <a href=\"Keep%20Track%20of%20Your%20Keys\">so you don't lose them</a>. Coordinate with others who are coming and going so you don't accidentally lock each other out.\n",
      "55 2. Assess the situation. Try to clarify and define the problem as best you can.\n",
      "56 * How severe is it? Is this truly a crisis or merely an inconvenience or a setback?\n",
      "57 * What is the nature of the problem?\n",
      "58 3. Assess what is available to you. Being resourceful is, above all, about clever, creative use of resources. Don't forget that resources aren't all things. Do you have access to, or could you obtain, any of these things?\n",
      "59 * People. Whether you need bus fare to get home, good ideas, moral support, the use of a phone, or simply extra hands, involve others if you can. . <a href=\"Brainstorm\">Brainstorm</a>ing <a href=\"Brainstorm%20With%20a%20Group%20of%20People\">together</a> may result in some great, joint solutions. Ask people you know and trust. Seek professional help. Or, as appropriate, ask anybody in charge (authorities, employees, docents, ushers), since these people often have access to additional resources. Even if you end up asking help of strangers, you will probably be pleasantly surprised by the results. If one or two people are not enough, could you form a team or task force? Could you persuade city hall or another organization to further your cause?\n",
      "60 * Communications. Could you contact somebody who might know the answer, lend a hand, etc.?\n",
      "61 * Information. Has somebody solved a similar problem before? How does the thing (or system or situation) work that you are trying to deal with? Which way is home from here? Whom can you contact, and how? How do you <a href=\"Build%20a%20Fire\">build a fire</a>?\n",
      "62 * Money. It can't get you out of every jam, but it can be pretty powerful in some situations. If you don't have money and you need it, being resourceful may consist either of doing without it or of raising some. Could you <a href=\"Panhandle\">ask people</a>, <a href=\"Fundraise\">hold a fundraiser</a>, or <a href=\"Get%20a%20Job\">get a job</a>, for instance?\n",
      "63 * Objects. Don't be afraid to use these in unconventional ways. Wire coat hangers can be incredibly flexible, for instance, and while screwdrivers aren't really intended for chiseling, prying, pounding, scraping, etc., they'll often do in a pinch.\n",
      "64 * Time. If you have it, use it. Again, you may need to figure out where you can get some more. Depending on the situation you need to overcome, you may need to work longer hours, ask for more time, enlist the time of others, or simply <a href=\"Be%20Patient\">be patient</a>.\n",
      "65 4. Try working backwards. How can you apply what you have at hand to the problem?\n",
      "66 5. Break the rules. Don't go around carelessly disregarding the law. Do use things in unconventional ways or go against conventional wisdom or societal norms, if it will help. Be prepared to take responsibility, redress wrongs, or explain yourself if you do overstep your bounds.\n",
      "67 6. <a href=\"Be%20Creative\">Be creative</a>. Think of crazy possibilities as well as obvious or practical ones. You might find inspiration for a workable solution in one of them.\n",
      "68 7. Experiment. Trial and error might take a while, but if you have no experience with a particular situation, it's a very good way to begin. At the least, you will learn what does not work.\n",
      "69 8. Use the situation to your advantage, if you can. If you missed the bus and the next one doesn't come for another hour, could you enjoy a cup of coffee or browse a store nearby while you wait? If the weather is freezing, could you use <a href=\"Build%20a%20Snow%20Cave\">snow as shelter</a> or ice as a building material?\n",
      "70 9. Improvise. Use what you have around for a temporary solution. Fix your bike enough to limp home and do a proper job later.\n",
      "71 10. <a href=\"Stop%20Procrastinating\">Act quickly</a>. Often an effective solution hinges on a speedy response. Even if it doesn't strictly require immediate attention, start when you have fresh energy and concern for the problem. You will never finish what you do not start.\n",
      "72 11. Be persistent. If you go away before the problem does, then you haven't solved anything. Try again, a dozen or a hundred different ways, if that's what it takes. Don't give up.\n",
      "75 ## Tips\n",
      "77 * <a href=\"Be%20Calm%20in%20a%20Stressful%20Situation\">Don't panic</a>. Pressure may be a good motivator, but not if it's clouding your thinking. Think about why you can't just give up on this and that will give you the edge for the persistence you need to succeed.\n",
      "78 * Practice being resourceful, before the pressure is on. Try cooking a meal with whatever is on hand in the <a href=\"Stock%20a%20Kitchen%20Pantry\">pantry</a> rather than going out to the store late at night. Invent the tool you need instead of buying it. Build or create your own, even if something is ready made and available.\n",
      "79 * If you've jury-rigged something to get through an immediate difficulty, make sure to do a proper job of repairing it as soon as possible.\n",
      "80 * Human contacts, like physical tools, can be collected in advance of when you need them. Networking, formal or informal, is one way to go about that collection. Also, if possible, offer others favors before you need to ask for any.\n",
      "84 ## Warnings\n",
      "86 * In case of a true emergency (an immediate threat to life or property), usually the best and most resourceful thing you can do is to summon the appropriate authorities, give them the information they need to do their jobs, and then stay out of the way.\n",

Learn to <a href=\"Pitch%20a%20Pop%20up%20Tent\">pitch your tent</a> in the back yard, or take a short day hike to get used to your backpacking gear.

If you worry that you might forget your keys and <a href=\"Pick%20a%20Lock\">lock yourself out</a>, hide a spare key in the back yard.

      "112 * Time. If you have it, use it. Again, you may need to figure out where you can get some more. Depending on the situation you need to overcome, you may need to work longer hours, ask for more time, enlist the time of others, or simply <a href=\"Be%20Patient\">be patient</a>.\n",

Try cooking a meal with whatever is on hand in the <a href=\"Stock%20a%20Kitchen%20Pantry\">pantry</a> rather than going out to the store late at night. Invent the tool you need instead of buying it.

These are two different problems, since the latter might be accomplished by passing through a window, by climbing over or under a wall, by going around the back way, or by removing the hinge pins in the door. For that matter, do you need access at all, or could you get what you need somewhere else?\n",
      "254 3. Assess what is available to you. Being resourceful is, above all, about clever, creative use of resources. Don't forget that resources aren't all things. Do you have access to, or could you obtain, any of these things?\n",

Whether you need bus fare to get home, good ideas, moral support, the use of a phone, or simply extra hands, involve others if you can. . <a href=\"Brainstorm\">Brainstorm</a>ing <a href=\"Brainstorm%20With%20a%20Group%20of%20People\">together</a> may result in some great, joint solutions. Ask people you know and trust. Seek professional help. Or, as appropriate, ask anybody in charge (authorities, employees, docents, ushers), since these people often have access to additional resources.

      "257 * Information. Has somebody solved a similar problem before? How does the thing (or system or situation) work that you are trying to deal with? Which way is home from here? Whom can you contact, and how? How do you <a href=\"Build%20a%20Fire\">build a fire</a>?\n",
      "258 * Money. It can't get you out of every jam, but it can be pretty powerful in some situations. If you don't have money and you need it, being resourceful may consist either of doing without it or of raising some.

      "260 * Time. If you have it, use it. Again, you may need to figure out where you can get some more. Depending on the situation you need to overcome, you may need to work longer hours, ask for more time, enlist the time of others, or simply <a href=\"Be%20Patient\">be patient</a>.\n",

      "265 8. Use the situation to your advantage, if you can. If you missed the bus and the next one doesn't come for another hour, could you enjoy a cup of coffee or browse a store nearby while you wait?

      "274 * <a href=\"Be%20Calm%20in%20a%20Stressful%20Situation\">Don't panic</a>. Pressure may be a good motivator, but not if it's clouding your thinking. Think about why you can't just give up on this and that will give you the edge for the persistence you need to succeed.\n",
      "275 * Practice being resourceful, before the pressure is on. Try cooking a meal with whatever is on hand in the <a href=\"Stock%20a%20Kitchen%20Pantry\">pantry</a> rather than going out to the store late at night. Invent the tool you need instead of buying it. Build or create your own, even if something is ready made and available.\n",
      "276 * If you've jury-rigged something to get through an immediate difficulty, make sure to do a proper job of repairing it as soon as possible.\n",

This could be a true tool kit, or it could be a <a href=\"Pick%20Items%20to%20Put%20Inside%20a%20Purse\">purse</a>, a <a href=\"Change%20a%20Diaper\">diaper bag</a>, a <a href=\"Be%20Prepared%20for%20Natural%20Disasters\">survival kit</a>, a <a href=\"Buy%20Power%20Tools\">workshop</a>, a <a href=\"Organize%20a%20Kitchen\">kitchen</a>, an <a href=\"Secure%20Items%20in%20the%20Back%20of%20Your%20Truck\">equipment truck</a>, or even your selection of <a href=\"Make%20a%20List%20for%20Gear%20to%20Take%20Camping\">camping gear</a>. Learn to use your tools. Then, make sure you have it with you when you need it.\n",
      "298 * Practice at home. If you don't know how to <a href=\"Change%20a%20Tire\">change a tire</a>, try it in your driveway before you get a flat miles away from home, in the dark, in the rain. Learn to <a href=\"Pitch%20a%20Pop%20up%20Tent\">pitch your tent</a> in the back yard, or take a short day hike to get used to your backpacking gear. Refine both your tool kit and your skills before you must put them to the test.\n",
      "299 * Anticipate likely problems and deal with them <a href=\"Be%20Proactive\">before they become problems</a>. If you worry that you might forget your keys and <a href=\"Pick%20a%20Lock\">lock yourself out</a>, hide a spare key in the back yard.
