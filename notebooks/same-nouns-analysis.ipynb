It's not easy to put yourself across all that easily which is the basic purpose of all forms of communication.Writing is one of the ways by which knowledge is shared,transfered and conveyed.So important is the essence of clear writing that without it the torrents of knowledge that change hands every day would stop, thereby bringing the business of life to a standstill..However there are ways by which the legibility of writing can be improved and the logjam of communication banished.There are four steps that can bolster the clarity of writing which can be listed as follows:\n",

Some people find success laying a single sheet of foil on the bottom of the oven. However, the foil may melt and it does not work for gas ovens. You could try lining a baking tray with foil and setting that under the plums.\n",
      "4 \t 3. Set the plums in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit. You should set the oven as low as possible. For most ovens, that is 200 degrees Fahrenheit. If your oven is different, simply set the oven to the lowest possible temperature.\n",
      "5 \t * Make sure to place the oven rack in the oven slowly. You do not want to knock the plums around.\n",
      "6 \t 4. Check the plums every few hours. You should flip the plums every few hours so they dry out evenly. You should also check on how the dehydration process is coming along. You want your prunes to be slightly soft and juicy, while also being dry to the point of having a wrinkled, dark appearance.\n",
      "7 \t * This also depends on personal preference. Some people prefer prunes slightly dryer while some prefer them juicier. Do not remove the prunes until they're at your desired state.\n",
