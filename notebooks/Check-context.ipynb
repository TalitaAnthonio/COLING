      "3 \t 1. Their are 4 kinds of assults on most maps.\n",
      "4 \t 2. A. air raid, B. air deplyment, C. naval (not always avalable) D. rapid armor, infantry, light transport deploy.\n",
      "5 \t 3. For the air raid, i will take the Battle of Britan as an example. As playing as German Luftwafta, you have the selection of fighters bombers and divebombers (if you want to be ainel, there are a list and discription of units at the end.) Messerschmitt BF 109E, Messerschmitt BF 110G, Heinkel He 111H, Junkers Ju 87B-2 \"Stuka\", Junkers Ju 88A. use your messerschmitts as escorts. stay in formation and the british plains can not get at the bomber's blindspots; between tail and ball turet gunners cant hit. if you keep your speed low, you can cover that blind spot. if you want to be part of the actul bomber team, get into the ball turet or if you are new to multi-gun birds, then choose the stern turret. unless you are experienced at it, then use the tail guns, but only if you are ready. If gunning down fighters does not apeal to you, then take to the cockpit. the piolet must have a good judge of distance per speed. the time the bombs meet the ground, is (pending with altitude) most likely by the time the tail of the plain has past the target on the mini-map. now then thats all nice and good but what if your facing the heat? in the Battle of Britan map, the allies have been given as listed:\n",
      "6 \t * Boulton Paul P82 \"Defiant\" Mk I\n",
      "7 \t * Hawker Hurricane Mk I\n",
      "8 \t * Supermarine Spitfire\n",
      "9 \t 4. the Defiant is a good starter. its slower speeds alow for training against bombers. it uses 8 .50 brownings. the bullets come out faster than one would think. for a more sesond piolet, then the hurricane mk1 would be the choice plane. this plain has .30 mg primary, 20MM cannon secondary. the cannon is good for flying the bomber's blind spot. the only thing is that your limmited speed, monourvability, and ammo capasity, makes it the better bomber hunter, but the worst dog fighter. the spitfire is for the ace. it has impeckable speed, best in the british airforce. it has 4 .30 MG. it is very versitle. its strong armor alwos for some slips in the bombers blind spot, but its strong engin alows for chaising after fighters.\n",
      "10 \t 5. In this section i shall go into detale about Air deployment. It is may 20 on the small island of creat. then the afrika corp attacks. with them they are using Light Air Transports. *speial note, in FH mod you must find or choose the piolet class to use a parachute. in the battle of creat, you have a parachute in all classes.*\n"

      "1 \t English is a difficult language to learn and even more so to speak with native fluency.\n",
      "2 \t By immersing yourself in the language, using media to practice, and enhancing your appearance as a native speaker, you can perfect your ability to speak English in no time.\n",
      "3 \t ## Steps\n",
      "4 \t ### Immersing Yourself\n",
      "5 \t 1. Find a native conversation partner in person or online.\n",
      "6 \t If your experience with English has largely been in textbooks, it can be helpful to practice your conversation skills with a native English speaker.\n",
      "7 \t Conversing regularly with a skilled English speaker will enable you to speak more fluidly and develop a natural speaking cadence.\n",
      "8 \t You can seek out a native speaker to partner with for conversation through Meetup.com or a local university.\n",
      "9 \t * If you don’t have time to seek out a partner in person, many online service such as Italki.com can connect you with a native speaker over Skype for one-on-one conversation sessions.\n",
      "10 \t 2. Take a class.\n",
      "11 \t A classroom setting allows you to brush up your language skills in areas of confidence and improve your skills where you lag.\n",
      "12 \t You may feel at ease practicing in front of others who fall a little short of fluency as well.\n",
      "13 \t ESLdirectory.com provides a great database to browse ESL classes in your area.\n",
      "14 \t 3. Study abroad.\n",
      "15 \t Immersing yourself completely in not just an English-speaking population but also an English-speaking culture can take your fluency to the next level.\n",
      "16 \t Seek out university programs in the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia or New Zealand for further study.\n",
      "17 \t Many accept international students year-round.\n",
      "18 \t ### Using Media\n",
      "19 \t 1. Take an online course.\n",
      "20 \t It used to be that you needed to shell out lots of money for online English classes, but that is changing thanks to MOOCs or Massive Open Online Courses.\n",
      "21 \t These courses are taught online at the college level and often by high-ranking professors.\n",
      "22 \t Best of all?\n",
      "23 \t Most are free.\n",
      "24 \t * Top MOOEC’s to seek out are Alison, FutureLearn and EdX.\n",
      "25 \t Many offer specialized classes that focus on improving conversation skills, verb tenses and more, so you can improve the particular area that you have trouble with to perfect your English.\n"
