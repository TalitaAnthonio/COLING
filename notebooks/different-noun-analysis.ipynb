      "3 \t Does your child suck on their fingers? Although most people suck their thumbs, children also develop the habit of sucking their fingers. It's a bad habit and it needs to be broken as soon as possible - here's how to do it!\n",
      "4 \t ## Steps\n",
      "5 \t 1. Start small. If you're in public and your child starts sucking their fingers, tell him/her that big girls and boys don't suck their fingers. This alone can motivate children to stop sucking their fingers in order to be a \"big boy\" or a \"big girl\". If your child is a bit older, remind him/her how embarrassing it will be if somebody sees them sucking their fingers.\n",
      "6 \t 2. Control it even when it seems that you can't. If your child has controlled their finger-sucking while they're awake, but still suck their fingers when they're asleep, try putting a glove or mitten on their hands before bed. It helps if it's scratchy wool, because then, when they go to suck their fingers in the night, the glove protects it and the scratchiness will tell them not to suck on it anymore.\n",
      "7 \t 3. Don't make it easy for them! The disadvantage to wearing the glove to bed is that children can take it off easily and continue sucking on their fingers. If you can't control their finger-sucking whatsoever, you can buy a type of drug you can almost paint your nails with. It goes on clear, maybe a bit tinted, but mostly nobody can tell it's on. It has a HORRIBLE flavor, so usually if you suck on it, you pull away immediately because of the taste! It's called Mavala STOP. It's available at most drugstores like London Drugs. If you can't find it, ask if they have it.\n",
      "8 \t 4. Encourage them. Breaking a habit is a hard thing for a child to do, so make sure to encourage them every step of the way. Never give up on them! If you give up on them, they're likely to give up on themselves, and the habit will never be broken. Make sure that they don't give up and that they perservere until the habit is broken! Remind them how good it will feel to be a \"big girl/boy\" or to never be embarrassed by their finger-sucking again.\n",
      "9 \t 5. Reward them. Once their finger-sucking habit is broken, reward your child! You can buy them a toy that they've always wanted, take them to the zoo or the park, or take them out for ice cream to celebrate. A reward will tell your child that their efforts are appreciated and that breaking their habit was a good thing.\n",
