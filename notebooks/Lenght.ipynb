Be persistent. If you go away before the problem does, then you haven't solved anything. Try again, a dozen or a hundred different ways, if that's what it takes. Don't give up.\", '## Tips', '* <a href=\"Be%20Calm%20in%20a%20Stressful%20Situation\">Don\\'t panic</a>. Pressure may be a good motivator, but not if it\\'s clouding your thinking. Think about why you can\\'t just give up on this and that will give you the edge for the persistence you need to succeed.', '* Practice being resourceful before the pressure is on. Try cooking a meal with whatever is on hand in the <a href=\"Stock%20a%20Kitchen%20Pantry\">pantry</a> rather than going out to the store late at night. Invent the tool you need instead of buying it. Build or create your own, even if something is ready made and available.', \"* Don't dwell on the past. If the root cause or original problem is something you can't fix, simply work to recover as best you can.\", \"* If you've jury-rigged something to get through an immediate difficulty, make sure to do a proper job of repairing it as soon as possible.\", '* Human contacts, like physical tools, can be collected in advance of when you need them. Networking, formal or informal, is one way to go about that collection. Also, if possible, offer others favors before you need to ask for any.', '## Warnings', '* In case of a true emergency (an immediate threat to life or property), usually the best and most resourceful thing you can do is to <a href=\"Call%20911\">summon the appropriate authorities</a>, give them the information they need to do their jobs, and then stay out of the way.']\n"
