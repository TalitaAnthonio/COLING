      "6 \t 4. Smile. Avoid appearing overconfident as she may find you cocky, but you mustn't be shy either. Some girls do like shy guys. But most of them want a guy who's not afraid to go out on a limb sometimes.\n",

Approach with confidence; don't use cheesy pick-up lines (A pick-up line is a conversation opener with the intent of engaging an unfamiliar person for sex, romance, or dating. ...), they rarely work.
