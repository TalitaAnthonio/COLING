```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read data 

```{r}
agreement <- read.csv(file='agreement_coling.tsv', head=TRUE, sep='\t')
head(agreement)
install.packages("irr")
library("irr")
str(agreement)
```

## Calculate the kappa

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library("irr")
kappa2(agreement)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
